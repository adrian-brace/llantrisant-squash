						<p class="textParagraph">
							We are a thriving, friendly and sociable club and we always welcome new members of all ages and abilities. We have a handful of Squash teams in the South Wales/Mid Glam leagues, and a growing contingent of regular Racketball players too.
							We now hold an annual <a class="loneAnchor" ng-click="scrollTo('llantrisant_open')">Open Squash tournament</a> each Summer that is on the <a class="loneAnchor" href='https://www.squash.wales"'>Squash Wales</a> calendar, and we
							try to hold a variety of fun <a class="loneAnchor" ng-click="scrollTo('events')">events</a> throughout the year (e.g. <a class="loneAnchor" ng-click="scrollTo('christmas_tournament')">Christmas squash tournament</a>, <a class="loneAnchor" ng-click="scrollTo('racketball_tournaments')">racketball tournament</a> nights, curry nights, charity cycles, golf tournaments, <a class="loneAnchor" ng-click="scrollTo('annual_tour')">squash tour</a> weekend away, etc), as well as popping to the pub for the occasional pint.
						</p>
						<h3 class="titleLevel2" id="getting_involved">Getting Involved</h3>
						<p class="textParagraph">
							For squash, "club night" is generally arranged through whatsapp on an ad-hoc basis. Out of season (May-Aug) generally on a Wed or Thurs. For racketball, there are a handful of groups of players that play on Friday and Sunday evenings with a general mix-in/round robin approach. Another way to get involved in squash would be to <a class="loneAnchor" href="./ladders">join the box leagues ladder</a>, or pop down to the centre's courts on a <a class="loneAnchor" href="./fixtures">home league match</a> from 19:15 onwards and have a chat to one of the players/supporters that will be in attendence.
							Some of the Racketball players try to block book a regular court slot and have a round robin together, e.g. Friday 17:45 to 19:15.

							Junior coaching sessions are run by fully qualified coaches. <a class="loneAnchor" href='./#/coaching'>See more details of junior coaching</a>. We also allow and would actively encourage the more confident and age appropriate juniors to participate in the competitive adult league season within our teams, to get good league squash experience and help develop their game.

						<h4 class="titleLevel3" id="rankings">Rankings</h4>
						<p class="textParagraph">
							The ranking committee is made up of captains and committee members and they discuss and decide on the <a class="loneAnchor" href='./#/club_ranking_list'>rankings</a> for league teams. A club ranking list is created and published at the beginning of the summer, during which a challenge process is activated.
							The final club rankings are decided upon in time for submission to <a class="loneAnchor" href='https://www.squash.wales'>Squash Wales</a> before the Winter Season begins. <a class="loneAnchor" href='./#/club_ranking_list'>Rankings</a> can be revised (for South Wales teams only) during the season within individual teams but only if agreed with Squash Wales.
							You will not be ranked unless you have paid your annual membership fee where applicable. The current committee as of August 2024 is:
							<ul>
								<li class="textParagraphList"><strong>Jason Jones (Chairperson)</strong></li>
								<li class="textParagraphList"><strong>Adrian Brace (Secretary & A Captain)</strong></li>

							</ul>
						</p>
						<p class="textParagraph">
							Ranking for league squash is determined by Squash Wales' own rules of Ranking using Squash Levels and a 20% tolerance. We also try to take other factors into consideration and is done as best we can as a voluntarily run club. Some of these factors (though not limitted to) are ability, availability on team nights, verbal commitment and declaration of work and family commitments, payment of membership fee, injury status, team's division relative to rest of the south wales leagues, team's division relative to other teams in the club, results from the challenge system, reliability and attendence for team squash in previous seasons, potential rotation and development of juniors.

						<h4 class="titleLevel3" id="challenge_system">Challenge System</h4>
						<p class="textParagraph">
							We run a challenge system through the summer months and the christmas break between seasons and the rules are as follows:

						<ul class='textParagraphList'>
							<li class='textParagraphList'>Challenge 1 place above ranked order, unless 1 place above you gives permission to skip over them.</li>
							<li class='textParagraphList'>Players agree on best of 3 or best of 1 match</li>

						<h4 class="titleLevel3" id="league_match_fees">League Match Fees</h4>
						<p class="textParagraph">
							The cost of hosting HOME League matches comprises of <b>court time hire</b> from the leisure centre (2 courts all evening from 19:15 onwards) and <b>catering costs</b> to feed both teams.
							These costs are charged to team players who play each home and away fixture as a match fee on the night. The amount charged is at the captain's discretion and depends on catering arrangements and court fees for that given season.
							The match fees charged to Juniors/Students will be at a reduced rate and the club will make up the difference. Players who play "up" for a team who have another match for their own team within the same week will also be charged a reduced rate for the match fee.

						<h3 class="titleLevel2" id="events">Events</h3>
						<h4 class="titleLevel3" id="annual_tour">Annual Tour</h4>
						<p class="textParagraph">
							The 1st May bank holiday of every year is reserved for the annual "Tour". This may or may not involve a shorthaul flight abroad and is generally 2 or 3 nights but always over the bank holiday weekend. It's very much a social tour. We don't always take rackets to play squash/racketball. If there is a local squash club at our chosen destination then every effort is made to arrange a ranked match up if they are willing and available to put out a list of players.

						<p class="textParagraph">
							We hold a 1 day annual Christmas Handicap Tournament, usually on the last working day of the year after Christmas, depending when Christmas Day falls. This is a compeitive and sociable event where we generally have a curry, drinks, killer darts and killer pool afterwards in a local pub.

							The racketball contingent hold occasional Racketball tournaments in the year (generally summer and winter) which are a one day or evening event of a 2 league racketball round robin followed by a final between league winners, and then a curry (& beers).
