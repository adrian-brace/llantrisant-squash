			<p class="textParagraph">
				We are a thriving, friendly and sociable club and we always welcome new members of all ages and abilities. We have a handful of Squash teams in the South Wales/Mid Glam leagues, and a growing contingent of regular Racketball players too.
				We now hold an annual Open Squash tournament each June that is on the <a class="loneAnchor" href='http://www.walessquashandracketball.co.uk/'>Squash Wales</a> calendar, and we
				try to hold a variety of fun events throughout the year (e.g. racketball tournament nights, curry nights, charity cycles, golf tournaments, squash tour weekend away, etc), as well as popping to the pub for the occasional pint.
			</p>
			<h3 class="titleLevel2" id="getting_involved">Getting Involved</h3>
			<p class="textParagraph">
				We don't host a formal "club night" for squash nor racketball as such. The best way to get involved would be to <a class="loneAnchor" href="./#/ladders">join the ladder</a>, for Squash or Racketball, or pop down to the centre's courts on a <a class="loneAnchor" href="./fixtures">home league match</a> from 19:15 onwards and have a chat to one of the players/supporters that will be in attendence.
				Some of the Racketball players try to block book a regular court slot and have a round robin together, e.g. Friday 17:45 to 19:15.

			</ul>
			<p class="textParagraph">
				The cost of hosting HOME League matches comprises of <b>court time hire</b> from the leisure centre (2 courts all evening from 19:15 onwards) and <b>catering costs</b> to feed both teams.
				These costs are charged to team players who play each home and away fixture as a match fee on the night. The amount charged is at the captain's discretion and depends on catering arrangements and court fees for that given season.
				The match fees charged to Juniors/Students will be at a reduced rate and the club will make up the difference. Players who play "up" for a team who have another match for their own team within the same week will also be charged a reduced rate for the match fee.
