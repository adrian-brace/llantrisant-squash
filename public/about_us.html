			<p class="textParagraph">
				We are a thriving, friendly and sociable club and we always welcome new members of all ages and abilities. We have a handful of Squash teams in the South Wales/Mid Glam leagues, and a growing contingent of regular Racketball players too.
				We now hold an annual <a class="loneAnchor" ng-click="scrollTo('llantrisant_open')">Open Squash tournament</a> each Summer that is on the <a class="loneAnchor" href='http://www.walessquashandracketball.co.uk/'>Squash Wales</a> calendar, and we
				try to hold a variety of fun <a class="loneAnchor" ng-click="scrollTo('events')">events</a> throughout the year (e.g. <a class="loneAnchor" ng-click="scrollTo('christmas_tournament')">Christmas squash tournament</a>, <a class="loneAnchor" ng-click="scrollTo('racketball_tournaments')">racketball tournament</a> nights, curry nights, charity cycles, golf tournaments, <a class="loneAnchor" ng-click="scrollTo('annual_tour')">squash tour</a> weekend away, etc), as well as popping to the pub for the occasional pint.
			</p>
			<h3 class="titleLevel2" id="getting_involved">Getting Involved</h3>
			<p class="textParagraph">
				We don't host a formal "club night" for squash nor racketball as such. The best way to get involved would be to <a class="loneAnchor" href="./#/ladders">join the ladder</a>, for Squash or Racketball, or pop down to the centre's courts on a <a class="loneAnchor" href="./fixtures">home league match</a> from 19:15 onwards and have a chat to one of the players/supporters that will be in attendence.
				Some of the Racketball players try to block book a regular court slot and have a round robin together, e.g. Friday 17:45 to 19:15.

				The club is privately run and organised by a small committee, but squash and racketball is played on the courts at <a class="loneAnchor" href='http://www2.rctcbc.gov.uk/en/leisure/findacentre/llantrisantleisurecentre/llantrisantleisurecentre.aspx'>Llantrisant Leisure Centre</a> which is owned and run by <a class="loneAnchor" href='http://www.rctcbc.gov.uk/'>Rhondda Cynon Taf Council</a>.

				The League Season runs approximately September to April, split into Winter and Spring seasons which have promotion/relegation changes between those seasons.
				We have a club rule that if you wish to play for a Llantrisant league team, then you are not permitted to play for another club in the league.
				Home matches for each team are on a fixed night, but away matches outside Premier A could be on any night.

			<h4 class="titleLevel3" id="club_membership">Club Membership</h4>
			<p class="textParagraph">
				An annual membership fee is charged to only the <b>adult <u>LEAGUE</u> players only</b>. Membership is <b>FREE for juniors and students</b>.
				The Membership fee is approximately £60 per annum, decided upon by the committee each year, and goes towards team registration costs with <a class="loneAnchor" href='http://www.walessquashandracketball.co.uk/'>Squash Wales</a> and balls.

			<p class="textParagraph">
				Junior coaching sessions are run by fully qualified coaches on weekend mornings. <a class="loneAnchor" href='./#/coaching'>See more details of junior coaching</a>. We also allow and would actively encourage the more confident juniors to participate in the competitive adult league season within our teams, to get good league squash experience and help develop their game.
			</p>
			<h4 class="titleLevel3" id="rankings">Rankings</h4>
			<p class="textParagraph">
				The ranking committee is made up of captains and committee members and decides on the <a class="loneAnchor" href='./#/club_ranking_list'>rankings</a> for league teams. A club ranking list is created and published at the beginning of the summer, during which a challenge process is activated.
				Then the final club rankings are decided upon in time for submission to <a class="loneAnchor" href='http://www.walessquashandracketball.co.uk/'>Squash Wales</a> before the Winter Season begins. <a class="loneAnchor" href='./#/club_ranking_list'>Rankings</a> can be revised during the season within individual teams but only if agreed with Squash Wales.
				You will not be ranked unless you have paid your annual membership fee where applicable.
			</p>
			<h4 class="titleLevel3" id="league_match_fees">League Match Fees</h4>
			<p class="textParagraph">
				The cost of hosting HOME League matches comprises of <b>court time hire</b> from the leisure centre (2 courts all evening from 19:15 onwards) and <b>catering costs</b> to feed both teams.
				These costs are charged to team players who play each home and away fixture as a match fee on the night. The amount charged is at the captain's discretion and depends on catering arrangements and court fees for that given season.
				The match fees charged to Juniors/Students will be at a reduced rate and the club will make up the difference. Players who play "up" for a team who have another match for their own team within the same week will also be charged a reduced rate for the match fee.
			</p>
			<h3 class="titleLevel2" id="events">Events</h3>
			<h4 class="titleLevel3" id="annual_tour">Annual Tour</h4>
			<p class="textParagraph">
				The 1st May bank holiday of every year is reserved for the annual "Tour". This may or may not involve a shorthaul flight abroad and is generally 2 or 3 nights but always over the bank holiday weekend. It's very much a social tour. We don't always take rackets to play squash/racketball. If there is a local squash club at our chosen destination then every effort is made to arrange a ranked match up if they are willing and available to put out a list of players.
			</p>
			<h4 class="titleLevel3" id="llantrisant_open">Llantrisant Open</h4>
			<p class="textParagraph">
				We host a major ranked <a class="loneAnchor" href='./#/tournament_details'>Open Sqaush tournament</a> each year in the summer, generally in early to mid June.

			<h4 class="titleLevel3" id="christmas_tournament">Christmas Tournament</h4>
			<p class="textParagraph">
